# Python and RabbitMQ-based data sharing framework
Python RabbitMQ Data-Sharing Framework


This project is a further iteration of Andrew Nguyen's data-sharing framework utilizing the RabbitMQ asynchronous message broker and the MagicWormhole file library.
It is designed as a messaging system for science users to be able to collaborate and share data with one another, circumventing an often tedious and cumbersome process due to issues such as a lack of consistent infrastructure and differing file formats.

This research consists of a Python translation of the Java API created in the previous version as well as an application/console based experience of the framework desgined to increase accessibility and comprehensiveness.
